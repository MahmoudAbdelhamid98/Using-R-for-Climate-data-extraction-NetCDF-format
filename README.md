# Using-R-for-Climate-data-extraction-NetCDF-format
That was my first code ever, the aim of it was to extract climate data from multiple files at specific location using R programming language
the code can be made in a better way but it still has some useful parts

## The naming scheme was as follows: 

- pr_MNA-22_ICHEC-EC-EARTH_rcp85_r12i1p1_SMHI-RCA4_v1_day_20310101-20351231.nc
